# A Breakout clone written for the browser

With this version of Breakout (in contrast to [this version](http://github.com/Farmerjoe12/MDN_Game)) I used a JS framwork called Phaser. It is a simple graphics library making support for things like animations, tweens, and physics a whole lot easier than doing it by hand.

## Interesting Takeaways from Phaser

Using a 'game engine' framework makes developing games so much easier and more efficient. Adding a ball to the screen with movement and collision physics can be done in less than 10 LoC.

Reacting to events in game couldn't be simpler. Making game elements move and collide basically just requires the elements to be in the game and have collisions turned on.

## Possible Improvements

- Ball Velocity Changes
- HTML/CSS Menus
- Bonus scoring
- New modes
-- Double balls
-- Double paddles
-- New 'maps'
- File separation (JS and CSS out of HTML)
- Scaling and resolution opportunities
